# playlist-2-text
This tool converts any M3U, M3U8, PLS or ASX file to a list of songs that can then be numbered and capitalized.

This (for example) lets DJs get their played songs history fron Rekordbox, Serato, Traktor or VirtualDJ and rapidly have the list in text format for posting when uploading a recorded set to social media or for any other purpose.

For offline use download ALL the files to a folder and open index.html on any web browser.

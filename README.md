# m3u-to-text
This tool converts an M3U file to a list of songs that can be numbered.

This for example lets DJs get their played songs history fron Rekordbox, Serato, Traktor or VirtualDJ and rapidly have the list in text format for posting when uploading a recorded set to social media or for any other purpose.
